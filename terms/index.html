    <h1>OffGap Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to OffGap! We're thrilled to provide you with an easy-to-use platform for building and publishing your website.</p>
    <p>By using OffGap, you agree to these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>
  
    <hr />  
    
    <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
    <p><pre>1.1.</pre> <strong>“OffGap”</strong> means sole proprietorship (eenmanszaak) Rebel Plans, trading under the name “OffGap”, registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel) under KVK number 83362835.</p>
    <p><pre>1.2.</pre> <strong>Service</strong> means the OffGap website builder, including its content creation tools, associated hosting orchestration, content distribution features, user authentication, and all related functionalities provided by OffGap.</p>
    <p><pre>1.3.</pre> <strong>You</strong> or <strong>Customer</strong> refers to the individual or entity accessing or using the Service.</p>

    <h3>2. Who These Terms Apply To</h3>
    <p><pre>2.1.</pre> These Terms apply to all users of the Service. Depending on whether You are a "Consumer" or a "Business User," certain provisions may apply differently:</p>
    <p><pre>2.2.</pre> <strong>Consumer:</strong> If You are an individual using the Service for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside your trade, business, craft, or profession.</p>
    <p><pre>2.3.</pre> <strong>Business User:</strong> If You are an individual or entity using the Service for purposes relating to your trade, business, craft, or profession.</p>
    <p><pre>2.4.</pre> <strong>Mandatory Consumer Rights:</strong> If You are a Consumer, nothing in these Terms is intended to limit or override your mandatory legal rights under applicable Dutch or EU consumer protection laws, including rights related to a cooling-off period, statutory warranty for defects, and data subject rights as outlined in our Privacy Policy. Where a provision of these Terms conflicts with such mandatory rights, the mandatory rights shall prevail. Disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability (Sections 13 and 14) are subject to these mandatory consumer rights.</p>

    <h3>3. Your Agreement with OffGap</h3>
    <p><pre>3.1.</pre> By accessing or using the Service, You agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). These Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and OffGap regarding the Service, superseding any prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral.</p>
    <p><pre>3.2.</pre> If You do not agree with any part of these Terms, You may not use the Service. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of all revisions to these Terms.</p>
    <p><pre>3.3.</pre> OffGap will record each Customer’s acceptance of these Terms (including the version and timestamp) for audit and compliance purposes.</p>

    <h3>4. The OffGap Service</h3>
    <p><pre>4.1.</pre> OffGap is a website creation and publishing platform that simplifies the process of bringing your online presence to life via an intuitive, cross-platform interface—no coding required.</p>
    <p><pre>4.2.</pre> <strong>Subdomains & Custom Domains:</strong> You can choose to use a free subdomain (e.g., <code>yourname.offgap.com</code>) provided by OffGap. Alternatively, You may connect your own custom domain (e.g., <code>yourdomain.com</code>). Please note that custom domains are not provided by OffGap; You must purchase and configure them at your own expense from a third-party domain registrar.</p>
    <p><pre>4.3.</pre> OffGap provides setup guidance only. We do not warrant compatibility or correctness of any particular registrar’s system. You are solely responsible for the purchase, maintenance (including timely payments), and configuration of your custom domain. OffGap cannot take responsibility for your website not being available due to misconfiguration, untimely payment, or misuse of your domain registration services.</p>
    <p><pre>4.4.</pre> <strong>Availability:</strong> We strive to balance convenience, cost, reliability, and availability in selecting third-party hosting and distribution providers for the Service. Our aim is to deliver a fast, reliable, and highly available Service—but We make no guarantees of specific uptime or response times. You agree that OffGap is not responsible for outages or performance issues in those third-party services which are beyond our reasonable control.</p>
    <p><pre>4.5.</pre> Your website content, once created using OffGap's tools, goes live in seconds as a static, fast, and secure website, provided your domain is correctly configured, the third-party services We rely on (such as GitHub, Cloudflare, Firebase, Spaceship) are functioning, and there are no governmental limitations or other force majeure situations.</p>

    <h3>5. Our Reliance on Third-Party Services & Hosting Philosophy</h3>
    <p><pre>5.1.</pre> The essence of OffGap's Service is to simplify website creation. While We provide the intuitive interface for You to build your website, to store content, host, authenticate users, and distribute these websites, We rely on robust third-party services, primarily <strong>GitHub, Cloudflare, Firebase, and Spaceship</strong>.</p>
    <p><pre>5.2.</pre> <strong>No Direct Hosting:</strong> OffGap does not provide its own version control, direct hosting, CDN (Content Delivery Network), or rate limiting services. Instead, We leverage the capabilities of these leading platforms to temporarily host your web content and enable its public distribution.</p>
    <p><pre>5.3.</pre> <strong>Acceptance of Third-Party Terms:</strong> By using the OffGap Service, You confirm that You have reviewed and accept the terms of service and privacy policies of our providers (GitHub, Cloudflare, Firebase, Spaceship). OffGap is not liable for errors, interruptions, or penalties arising from those providers.</p>
    <p><pre>5.4.</pre> <strong>Customer Responsibility for Permanent Hosting:</strong> The public presence of your website through OffGap is primarily intended for Customer preview and further modification. It is not intended as a permanent, unlimited hosting solution capable of guaranteeing specific distribution, high availability, or handling substantial traffic loads. If You are satisfied with the content created using the OffGap Service and require guaranteed distribution, necessary availability, or the ability to handle significant traffic, You are responsible for moving this website content to a permanent hosting provider of your choice.</p>
    <p><pre>5.5.</pre> <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> OffGap's obligations under these Terms are suspended for any events or conditions beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of war, network failures, governmental actions, cyber-attacks, pandemics, or labor disputes.</p>

    <h3>6. Your Account</h3>
    <p><pre>6.1.</pre> <strong>Creation & Security:</strong> To use OffGap, You will need to create an account using your email address or a social login (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter). You must provide accurate and complete information and safeguard your account credentials. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities that occur under your account. To prevent harm to your website content and the public image of yourself, your product, and OffGap, You are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your account.</p>
    <p><pre>6.2.</pre> Please notify us immediately, and in any event within <strong>24 hours</strong>, of any unauthorized use of your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@offgap.com">support@offgap.com</a>.</p>
    <p><pre>6.3.</pre> <strong>No Sharing:</strong> Your OffGap account is for your individual use. Accounts are personal; sharing your credentials or login details with anyone else is strictly prohibited to avoid misuse of the Service and possible security and reputational damage.</p>
    <p><pre>6.4.</pre> <strong>Suspension & Termination:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account for security breaches or repeated violations of these Terms. We will notify You of any such action via an in-app banner (and email if one is on record for your account) with <strong>7 days</strong> to cure the violation or appeal the decision. Failure to respond within this period will result in forfeiture of your appeal rights.</p>
    <p><pre>6.5.</pre> <strong>Consequences of Termination/Deletion:</strong> Upon deletion of your account, your website will be immediately unpublished. We may retain backups of Your Content for legal compliance and disaster recovery purposes for at least <strong>30 days</strong> following termination, after which they will be permanently purged.</p>

    <h3>7. Your Content</h3>
    <p><pre>7.1.</pre> You are solely responsible for all content, including text, images, videos, audio, and any other materials ("Your Content") that You create, upload, publish, or display on your OffGap website.</p>
    <p><pre>7.2.</pre> <strong>Responsibility & Ownership:</strong> You alone own and are responsible for all materials You publish through the Service. Your responsibility for Your Content extends to compliance with all applicable local, corporate, governmental, and other regulations and laws. This responsibility applies not only in the country of your residence but may also be reviewed under international law and lead to consequences in other jurisdictions.</p>
    <p><pre>7.3.</pre> Content that might not be considered a violation at the time of publication could become a violation in the future as internet and content regulation policies become stricter over time. Therefore, You are responsible for taking necessary measures regarding Your Content as regulations evolve. While We believe in the free internet and freedom of thought, expression, and information sharing, We acknowledge that the creation, distribution, and consumption of certain content is or might become punishable. OffGap claims no ownership over Your Content.</p>
    <p><pre>7.4.</pre> <strong>License to OffGap:</strong> By publishing Your Content on OffGap, You grant OffGap a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, reproduce, and distribute your Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service, which includes making this content available on your website. OffGap will not use your content for marketing, commercial, or other purposes unrelated to making this content available on your website. This license terminates when You remove Content from the Service or delete your account.</p>
